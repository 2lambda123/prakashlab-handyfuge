# v0.2.3 Prototype

This prototype version is a modification by Anesta Kothari of the v0.2.2 design for release in the [Handyfuge-LAMP preprint on medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143255v1) to be easier to assemble:

- The rotor core plates were split up into 2 mm plates, to remove the need for cutting 1/4"-thick acrylic for the rotor core.
- The laser-cut part patterns were panelized into a single sheet.
- The rotor guard was removed to save space for panelization.


## Assembly

Assembly instructions for this prototype have not been created, but a stackup showing the ordering and alignment of plates is shown in Fig. 1 of the Handyfuge-LAMP preprint on medRxiv. This design uses M3 standoffs for structural support, as well as M2 and M3 dowel pins of various lengths, and some washers and spacers from McMaster-Carr.
