# v0.2.2 Prototype

This prototype version is a major evolution by Ethan Li on the v0.1.4 design, to add several design features to improve the safety, reliability, and speed of the handyfuge:

- A rotor guard adds physical shielding to reduce the risk of accidentally hitting the centrifuge tubes while the device is being operated.
- Support plates at the squeeze handle prevent the squeeze handle from jamming on the edges of nearby acrylic plates.
- A dowel pin constrains the relaxation of the squeeze handle to prevent wasted travel.
- Minor dimensional adjustments reduce friction and improve device performance and usability.
- The locations of the holes for the outer frame standoffs are standardized to be spaced in multiples of 5 mm.


## Assembly

Assembly instructions for this prototype have not been created, but photos of the assembled prototype [are available](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sdI5_rqlt_9IgPVxCfTqWUPCU-ixx4wc?usp=sharing). This design uses M3 standoffs for structural support, as well as M2 and M3 dowel pins of various lengths, and some washers and spacers from McMaster-Carr.


## Applications

This prototype version was the device used by Ethan Li for the device characterization presented in the July 1, 2020 version of the [Handyfuge-LAMP preprint on medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143255v1).

## Forking

The Onshape CAD for this prototype version can be found in the ["Compact (v0.2.2)" part studio of the v0.2.2 version](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2cf671f300bec1e37c7aebdd/v/64f6927857a6e069a135ad2d/e/14e672d36cf51ed47f4d48e6) of the Onshape workspace. Part configurations are available for 0.6 mL tubes, 1.5 mL tubes, and 2.0 mL tubes; and with or without a rotor guard to reduce the risk of foreign objects hitting centrifuge tubes; and with different rotor diameters. The laser cut files for this version were created by selecting the appropriate face of each part in the part studio and exporting as DXF files; in these files, the length unit is mm.
