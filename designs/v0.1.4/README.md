# v0.1.4 Prototype


This prototype version is the first created by Ethan Li to be assembled by taking parts from a single hand-squeeze flashlight for use with a rotor which can spin microcentrifuge tubes.


## Assembly

Assembly instructions for this prototype have not been created, but photos of the assembled prototype [are available](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QE24hF5hobyn_T7r6Pj2J-EpUPVJ-oRx?usp=sharing). This design uses M3 standoffs for structural support, as well as M2 and M3 dowel pins of various lengths, and some washers and spacers from McMaster-Carr.


## Applications

This prototype version was the device used by Adam Larson for the LAMP assay presented in the July 1, 2020 version of the [Handyfuge-LAMP preprint on medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143255v1).

## Forking

The Onshape CAD for this prototype version can be found in the ["Bear Squeeze Reconstruction" part studio of the v0.1.4 version](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2cf671f300bec1e37c7aebdd/v/0b79bdd1a180958896d4d577/e/14e672d36cf51ed47f4d48e6) of the Onshape workspace. Part configurations are available for 0.6 mL tubes, 1.5 mL tubes, and 2.0 mL tubes. The laser cut files for this version were created by selecting the appropriate face of each part in the part studio and exporting as DXF files; in these files, the length unit is mm.
