Photographs of the v0.2.1 prototype, showing the rotor guard to provide more mechanical enclosure of the rotor and taped-down electronics for measuring the rotational speed of the rotor:

## Designs

The CAD sources for these designs can be viewed and copied [at Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2cf671f300bec1e37c7aebdd/w/50c80549fc61639971846d73/e/14e672d36cf51ed47f4d48e6?configuration=List_Y2HIPiqMowNxyx%3DDefault%3BList_p3Npt1bOHtHOFd%3DGuard%3BList_t8Keu0A1rNYTF2%3D_1_5_mL_tube). Laser-cutting fabrication files, generated from the CAD sources, can be found in the `design` folder of this repository, organized by prototype version. Version numbering loosely follows the [semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org/), such that tiny design iterations increase the patch version number while significant new design features increase the minor version number, and backwards-incompatible public releases increase the major version number. More information about each prototype version can be found in the `README.md` file in the subfolder for that prototype version.

## Contact

To report issues with the designs or get help with using these designs, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ethanjli/handyfuge/issues/new). Please be aware that it may take a while for us to fully address issues (e.g. putting together a bill of materials for mechanical parts used in the designs), because of ongoing research disruptions from the COVID-19 situation.
